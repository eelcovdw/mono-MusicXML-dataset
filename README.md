# IMPORTANT

Musescore had to remove their public API in 2018, and I don't have permission to distribute this dataset myself. This dataset is no longer available.

# MuseScore Monophonic MusicXML Dataset
This repository contains the instructions to downloading the dataset used in [Optical Music Recognition with Convolutional Sequence-to-Sequence Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.04877). The dataset contains approximately 17.000 monophonic scores, divided over a train, validation, and evaluation set.

## Instructions
Only the public keys to scores on MuseScore are included in this repository. To obtain the data, you need a MuseScore API key. More information about obtaining a key and the API can be found [here](http://developers.musescore.com/). An example download script for python 3 is included in the scripts folder.
